# Bright-TV-Case-study
#Introduction 
Bright TV is a company that broadcasts variety of channels. I will be analyzing which shows have the highest consumption.
# Objective 

I will be analyzing how do they viewers perceive our shows. What type of shows do they frequently watch and how much time do they spend on watching the channels. The aim is to increase consumption and recommend strategies.

**Insights**

Most of our viwers have social media accounts which would contribute to the lesser views we get on our tv channels.Our channl;es are mostly watched in the evening, the least time is the morning as our audience would be preparing for work or getting btheir kids ready for school. Due to most of our audience having social media accounts, i suggested that we create an app or create an accountnwhereby the customers can watch the short clips which would enhance their interest. 

**Tools**

I will be using snowflake in order to generate clean data.
I will be using excel to create graphs
I will use PowerPoint to create presentations.
